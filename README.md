# Kickstarting with Excel
# Kickstarter_Analysis

## Overview of Project
In a short time, Louise's play Fever came very close to it's fundraising goal. So Louise wants to how different campaign performed in relation to their launch dates and funding goals. 

### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to visualize the Theatre campaign outcomes of success, fail, and cancel based on the launch date. The Kickstarter analysis looked at 2 campaigns, the Theatre campaign based on it's start date and the Play campaign based on it's funding goal.

## Analysis and Challenges
The first analysis was done on the Parent Category by years and further filtered by success, fail, and cancel campaigns. Further analysis was done using the pivot table filtering by parent category by Theater and success, fail, and cancel campaigns. The challenge in a way was parsing the year into its own column and producing the months in the pivot table.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
The Parent Category was further fitered to reflect the Theater campaign and the success, fail, and cancel outcome based on the launch date. The data shows May to be the most successful Theater campaign launched and also the most successful campaign. For failed campaign, it looks like August had the maost failed campaign and also the most failed Theater campaign launched. Out of the 1369 Theater campaigns launched, there were only 37 cancelled campaigns, with 5 canceled campaign being the most in May, October, and December.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
The Outcome Based on Goals analysis was done on the Plays campaign showing the percentage of successful, failed, and canceled campaign based on the funding goal amount. After analysising this data, it shows that for goals less than $1000 was the most successful campaigns with a 76% success rate. There were 186 total campaigns in that range. Goals between $1000 and $4999 had a total of 534 campaigns and was the second most successful campaing with 73%. The data shows the the goal range between $4500 and $49999 had a 0% successfu campaign and thus had the most failed campaign of 100%. Goals above $50000 had the most failed campaign, 83%. Since ther were not as many cancelled campaign comapred to the toal campaign launched, camceled campaign is 0% across the board.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
It was challenging to get the months on the pivot table for the successful, failed, and canceled campaigns for the Theater campaign. Also, listing the outcomes in descending order was a challenge and difficulty.

## Results
Based on the analysis, it can be concluded that campaigns launched in the month of May are more successful
than any other month of the year. Campaigns launched in December are least likely to be successful. August is the month with the most failed campaign and December the least failed campaign. When looking at total canceled campaigns, 37, with respect to total campaigns, 1369. there is only a 2.7% campaign that was canceled, not a bad cancellation rate. 

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
    Based on the analysis done for the launched date it can be concluded that May is the best month to launch     campaigns because it is the month where there are more successful campaigns launched and December being       the worst month to launch campaign. The least number of successful campaign was launched in December.
    
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
    With regards to Outcome Based on Goals, it can be concluded that goals of less than $1000 are more
    attainable because that was range had the highest success rate. Goals set between $45000 and $49000 are
    difficult to attain because the range had the least success rate, 0%. There were a lot more project done
    between the goal range of $5000 and $9999, so there were a lot more successful (141) and a lot more
    failed projects (146) and this range had the second most success rate.
    
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
-   This data was second had data that was given fo use in this project. There is not way to know the 
-   accuracy of this data or how it was collected to know if there were any bias or false information. It
-   would be difficult to know the representation of this data to previous data since that was not given.
-   The data is limited to one year. The analysis was done based on only the Theater and Plays campaign
-   and not all the campaigns.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
-   It would have been interesting to see the comparison of all the campaigns to know which one was more'
-   successful. This would give a better understanding of which campaign does better in which month.
-   Comparing only two campaigns does not give information on the entire campaigns. That is a very narrow'
-   focus that does not give the entire picture.
